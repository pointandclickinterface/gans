# Generative Adversarial Networks #

This is my repo where I keep the GANs I have made.

I make them as ipynb files to allow for easy reading of them but a future goal is to make regular python modules out of them to make them more usable/object oriented in the future.

## DC GAN 1 ##

This is my first DC gan. It uses pytorch and procedurally generates images that are 128 x 128 pixels. Images need to all be the same size to use this and it works better if they are square. I recommend my [image cropper](https://github.com/pointandclickinterface/image-processing/tree/main/Google%20Drive%20Image%20Cropper) for this job.
